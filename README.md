# DCousins_Charger

![alt text](https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/image.jpg?raw=true)

This repo is for use with Dan Cousins DDL/ANKI Vector charger with built in fan and LEDs.
The charger requires a raspberry pi with GPIO pins installed to work to its fully potential.

It contains a script that runs the fan and LEDs using the built in IR detection module in the charger.
